# Hello-World
Hello!

My name is Gunta, I am 27 years old and I want to become a first class programmer. I am on first step to take this goal, I know that it is the long road to go, but all roads starts with the one small step, so I am in! I am hard worker, so now I spend a lot of time to study, read, watch videos and search and search information all about. I am a dreamer who take the action for get dreams come true! So I hope that I will make something awsome in future and have my dream job with the best team.
